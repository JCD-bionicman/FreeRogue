# FreeRogue
A cross-platform roguelike game engine.


# Goals:
* Designed for games that use roguelike tilesets like NetHack, Rogue, and Dwarf Fortress.
* Well optimized in C++.
* Cross-platform with OpenGL (and maybe Vulkan later).
* Prebuilt user tileset modding system.
* Design tools for things like window resizing and GUI interfaces.
* Integrated engine utilities like time management and ECS.
