# FreeRogue
A cross-platform roguelike game engine.


# Goals:
* Designed for games that use roguelike tilesets like NetHack, Rogue, and Dwarf Fortress
* Well optimized in C++ (with eventual support for any .Net language)
* Cross-platform with OpenGL (and maybe Vulkan later)
* Prebuilt (and optional) user tileset modding system
* Helpful tools for things like window resizing and GUI interfaces
* Integrated engine utilities like time management and ECS
